      name: "Vata",
      description:
        "Vata’s elemental makeup consists of air and ether. The common translation of vata is “that which moves things.” Vata is often referred to as the wind in the body, and it is the primary motivating force of the doshas—without it, the other doshas are unable to move.",
      qualities: ["Cold", "Light", "Dry", "Irregular", "Rough", "Changeable"],
      balancingTips: [
        "If excessive stress in your life leads to your Vata force becoming imbalanced, your activity will start to feel out of control.",
        "A regular lifestyle routine helps ground Vata so you’re not carried away into the ethers.",
        "To balance Vata, make choices that bring warmth, stability, and consistency to your life. Try to get to bed before 10 p.m., wake up by 6 a.m., and eat your meals at regular times.",
      ],

    Pitta: {
      name: "Pitta",
      description:
        "The Pitta dosha controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production. The primary function of Pitta is transformation. Those with a predominance of the Pitta principle have a fiery nature that manifests in both body and mind.",
      qualities: ["Hot", "Light", "Acidic", "Intense", "Sharp", "Penetrating"],
      balancingTips: [
        "Pitta is hot, sharp, sour, pungent, and penetrating.",
        "To balance Pitta, make choices that are cooling, sweet, and stabilizing.",
        "Balance rest and activity, allowing some free time every day. Be careful not to create unnecessary time pressures for yourself.",
        "Regularly spend time in nature.",
        "Do not skip meals and do not wait until you are famished to eat.",

      name: "Kapha",
      description:
        "Kapha is based on earth and water. It can be described as steady, stable, heavy, slow, cold, and soft. Spring is known as Kapha season, as many parts of the world slowly exit hibernation.",
      qualities: ["Cold", "Wet", "Heavy", "Slow", "Sticky", "Solid"],
      balancingTips: [
        "Since Kapha is inherently cold, heavy, and dense, the key to balancing Kapha is stimulation.",
        "Kaphas tend to cling to the status quo and routine, so they need the stimulation of new sights, sounds, and experiences.",
        "Kaphas are particularly sensitive to cold, damp conditions and benefit from heat.",
        "Get regular exercise. This is the best way to avoid stagnation and the accumulation of toxins in the body.",

        "People with dual constitutions (two doshas) have personalities which are always in a sense “split”: under certain conditions, one dosha will predominate and under other circumstances the other dosha comes to the forefront. The inherent cohesion of personality which characterizes purely Vata, Pitta or Kapha people is more difficult to come by for those of us who have dual personalities, because we strive to balance the demands of two very dissimilar principles. Most individuals are dual in constitution.",
